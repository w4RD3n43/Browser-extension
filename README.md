##Browser Extension


####Welcome to My Awesome Browser Extension! This extension greets you, stores your name locally, greets you according to the time of day, displays a main task, includes a todo list, and shows a motivational quote at the bottom. It also removes all data if the day ends.


##Usage
Once installed, the extension will greet you with a "What's your name?" prompt. Enter your name, and the extension will greet you accordingly (e.g., "Good morning, John!"). It will also display your main task for the day, your todo list, and a motivational quote at the bottom of the page.

##Deployment
The extension is deployed at https://browser-extension-iota.vercel.app/.
